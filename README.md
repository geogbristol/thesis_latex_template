# thesis_latex_template
This is an **unofficial** example of latex thesis used by Lenka Hasova, based on University of Nottingham example.

If soeome knows whats going on with the .mlf, .mlt and .mtc files, let me know. They are pretty annoying.


If you are working on **Overleaf**, you could also use exitsting (different) template from overleaf:
